Differences between Abstract Classes & Interfaces
Interface:
    1) Interface contains only abstract methods
    2) Access Specifiers for method in interface must be public
    3) Variables defined must be public, static or final
    4) To implement an interface, we use implements keyword
Abstract Class:
    1) Abstract class can contain abstract methods, non-abstract methods
    2) Except private we can have any access modifiers for methods in abstract class
    3) Except private variables we can have any access specifiers
    4) To implement an abstract class, we use extends keyword


 Multiples Inheritance:
 Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes to avoid complexity and ambiguity (the "diamond problem").
 However, a class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit method signatures from multiple sources.
 This way, Java achieves a form of multiple inheritance without the complications.
