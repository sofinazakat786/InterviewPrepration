Stack: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out(LIFO) principle.

Key Points:
1. LIFO principle : Last In, First Out
2. Basic operations:
    * Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack
    * Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack
    * Peek: Returns the top element without removing it
    * isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.

3. Applications:
    * Expression evaluation and syntax parsing
    * Backtracking algorithms ( like maze solving).
    * Undo operations in applications.
    * Function call management in recursion

4. Implementation of Stack in Java:
    * Stack is already implemented in Java: Collection Framework : Stack
    * Stack can be implemented by Array.
