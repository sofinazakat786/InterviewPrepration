//Pointers in java?
//Java does not support pointers.
However, it supports references.
A reference is a variable that refers to an object.
A reference has a type, and can be used to refer to any object of that type or a subtype of that type.
References are similar to pointers in C++, but they are safer and more abstract.
//What is the difference between a reference and a pointer?
//A reference is a variable that refers to an object.
//A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of an object.

Class and object in java?
//A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
//An object is an instance of a class.
//A class defines the properties and behavior of objects.
example:
class Car {
  String color;
  int speed;
  void drive() {
    System.out.println("Driving at " + speed + " km/h.");
  }
}
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.color = "Red";
