Queue: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO(First In First Out) principle.
 The elements are added at the rear end and removed from the front end.

Key Operations:
1. Enqueue : Adding an element to the end of the queue.
2. Dequeue : Removing an element from the front of the queue.
3. Peek/Front: Getting the front element without removing it.
4. isEmpty: Checking the queue is empty.
5. isFull: Checking the queue is full

Types of Queue:
1. Simple Queue: A basic queue follows FIFO
                 Limitation: once full no more elements can be added even if some are removed
                 useCase: Customer service ticketing system.
2. Circular Queue: A queue where the rare pointer wraps around to the front when  the end of the array is reached, making better use of storage.
                 Key diff: Unlike a simple, it efficiently utilizes the array by reusing freed spaces:
                 UseCase : CPU scheduling, memory management
